This is an iteration on the mass_user_get script. It now takes a list of emails, 
finds the roles of those users, counts them, and then exports the counted roles 
to a CSV for the user to use. 

I am also going to edit it where you can just give the script a file path, 
and it will generate this CSV for you!
